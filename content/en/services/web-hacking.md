## Web Hacking â€“ From Zero to Practical Skills

### Who is this course for?

This course is for students who want to enter the ethical hacking world the right way â€” no shortcuts, no fluff.  
Itâ€™s also suitable for parents looking for a safe, valuable program that introduces their kids to cybersecurity hands-on, from the ground up.

### Why is this course different?

Because we donâ€™t just jump into hacking â€” we start by teaching how websites work. Then we move step by step into real attacks using safe environments and real tools.

No theoretical slides, no filler.  
Only real practice.

### What you will learn

#### 1. Understanding how web applications work

- What is HTTP/HTTPS? How does browser-server communication work?  
- The basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript for ethical hackers  
- Sessions and cookies explained  
- Introduction to SQL and databases

#### 2. Your essential hacking toolkit

- Working with Kali Linux  
- Introduction to Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP  
- Setting up safe vulnerable labs: DVWA, bWAPP

#### 3. Real-world attacks (hands-on practice)

**SQL Injection**  
- Learn how to access database content via user input  
- Live demo on a training website

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
- Inject JavaScript to steal cookies or manipulate pages  
- Practice XSS on sandboxed labs

**Command Injection**  
- Execute system-level commands through insecure input fields

**File Upload Exploitation**  
- Upload malicious files to take control of a server  
- Analyze weak file validation

**Authentication Bypass**  
- Trick login systems with crafted inputs  
- Break into insecure login forms you build yourself

#### 4. Legal & Ethical Foundations

- What is legal testing?  
- Why responsible hacking matters  
- Overview of certifications: CEH, OSCP

### Final Project

You will build and attempt to hack your own vulnerable web app in a safe environment, then document your findings like a real penetration tester.

### Delivery style

Every session is live or pre-recorded with real-time demos.  
No theory dumps. Just action.  
This is a **4-week course** with 2 sessions per week (60â€“90 mins each), and includes weekly assignments and hands-on labs.
